# Nuxt Notes

Started with just the thought of creating a CRUD with some notes.
Instead of the old TODO app, it's just a notes app, where the user can log
and do what ever they want with the notes.

Later on I realize that I could't just use a big Textarea. Then I found about
the concept of RTE, and wanted to build my own, but that was to much of a deal so, after trying a few ones, ended up liking Tiptap the most, and that's what the
app uses.
